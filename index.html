<h2>Soviet Empire Laws and Codes</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
  <td>This claus regards how members of the Soviet Onion are treated.
    Consuls cannot remove or give jobs based of their own agenda and must change jobs based of their countries agenda.
    If there is faliure to do this they are subject to be placed under Consul suspension for 3 days (see Consul Limits point 2).
    All members of the Soviet Onion are equals (even Consuls: whom just have jobs of high power) and should be treated
    with equal respect in regards to the law, with exeption to those who have been excommunicated from a religion or are
    criminals guilty of felony. (Cringe, Littering, Cancer Music.)
    Citezenship cannot be removed without a proper reason and removed citizenship must be communicated between Consuls
    within the point of reason.
    If someone feels as though one of these clauses has been violated they can speak of it freely and seek legal retribution.

An IU has its own:
Government (usually a dictatorship, decides who can enter the IU)
Population (all IU citizen are SO citizens but not all SO citizens are IU citizens)

Consuls are not allowed o be a citizen of any IU
Consuls can only interfere or dizzolve an IU with a vote of 3/3 (An IU can counter this vote with a veto from at least 80% of its population)

2/3 votes from a consul are required to create a union
When a union is created its population can be capped by the consuls
